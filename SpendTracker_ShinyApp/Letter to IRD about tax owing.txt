LETTER SENT 19th JAN VIA MYIRD, AND THEY SAY THEY'LL RESPOND IN 15 WORKING DAYS

To whom it may concern,

I owe IRD several thousand dollars according to a tax assessment letter I received from you last year. Based on the breakdown in this letter, my understanding is that a large part of the amount owing was due to two factors:

1. I was overpaid by ACC during a prolonged time off work, leading to a discrepancy between tax paid and earnings
2. The amount of my ACC levy was deducted from my PAYE, leading to shortfall in PAYE of around $1500.

I have been paying ACC back in installments and the overdue amount has now been repaid. Per a discussion I had with IRD about this last year, I am now letting you know of this fact so that you can re-calculate my earnings against tax paid. I have attached a screenshot of a confirmation email from ACC detailing the amount paid back, but please let me know if you need this confirmation in a different format. 

Also, I have spoken with ACC about the fact that my ACC levy did not count towards my PAYE last year and I was told this could be a mistake - ACC could not understand why, as an employee, my levy was deducted from my PAYE. Could you please explain why you did this, and fix if this was done in error?

To summarise, could you please re-calculate the amount I owe IRD after factoring in earnings that have been re-paid to ACC as well as the ACC levy being deducted from my PAYE. Please also let me know if there is a change to the date this payment is due.

Kind regards,

James Ruffell
