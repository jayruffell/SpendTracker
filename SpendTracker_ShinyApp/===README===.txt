Just source any of the app scripts (global, ui or server) to run the app.

Alternatively runApp.r can be used to run the scripts - aim is to source runApp.r and then make this a bat file so Emily can open it.

Note also that I think any data must be in the same directory or a subdirectory of the above scripts.

Batch file is so that Emily can launch the app with one click (there's a shortcut on the desktop).

# Improvements to dash
# - instructions that only show when data updates, then 'update data' button?
# - instructions, i.e. must have 4 files in downloads folder for new d/ls
# - show projected spend for current month based on days left
